# Autolog

_README generated with **Documatic**_.

Quickly generate changelogs
and release notes
by analysing your git history.
A python tool.
Format based on `KeepAChangelog`.

## Getting started

### Requirements

Minimum python 3.8.
Project actively supports python 3.8,
3.9,
3.10.
Clone the repository
and run `pip install -e .`
to package locally.

### API key

To generate a changelog
with a full feature-set,
Autolog requires a (free)
API key.
Join the waitlist
for an API key [here](https://www.documatic.com).
Autolog uses `python-dotenv`
to load environment variables
stored in a `.env` file.
To use your API key,
create a `.env` file
in your project root directory
with the following fields:

```
AUTOLOG_API_KEY = <your-api-key>
```

**IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD `.env` TO VERSION CONTROL.
YOUR API KEY MUST BE KEPT SECRET.**


### Generate a Changelog

In a terminal,
run `autolog`
to create
a `CHANGELOG.md`
from your git commit history,
or update an existing changelog.
See [configuration](#configuration)
for information on how to configure
the changelog.

## Concepts

### Git commit parsing

The initial logic for generating a changelog
comes from reading
your git commit messages.
`autolog`
expects
commit messages to begin with an imperitive verb,
and to written passively.
`autolog` parses the message for signalling words
and phrases.

E.g. `Rename 'my_func' to 'my_awesome_func'`
will get interpreted as a "Changed" feature.
Whereas `'my_func' -> 'my_awesome_func'`
will not.

### Configuration

You can configure how `autolog` runs
by adding a `tool.autolog` section
to `pyproject.toml`.

| Field | Purpose | Required | Default value |
|:------|:--------|:---------|:--------------|
| changelog | Name of changelog file generated. ".md" suffix added if not present. | No | CHANGELOG.md |
| local | If `true`, use a local sever for advanced features. Only used for project development | No | false |
